To change from a double deep Q network (DDQN) to a deep Q network (DQN) solution, you need to modify the way you calculate the target Q-values for the update step. 

In DDQN, you use the main network to select the best action for the next state, and the target network to estimate its value. 

In DQN, you use the target network for both action selection and value estimation. 

This means that in DDQN, the target Q-value is given by:

$$r + \gamma Q(s', \text{argmax}_a Q(s', a; \theta); \theta^-)$$

where:

$r$ is the reward, 

$\gamma$ is the discount factor, 

$s'$ is the next state, 

$Q(s', a; \theta)$ is the main network with parameters $\theta$, 

and $Q(s', a; \theta^-)$ is the target network with parameters $\theta^-$. 

In DQN, the target Q-value is given by:

$$r + \gamma \text{max}_a Q(s', a; \theta^-)$$

where: 

$r$, $\gamma$, $s'$, and $Q(s', a; \theta^-)$ are the same as before. 

The difference is that in DQN, you use the maximum Q-value over all actions from the target network, instead of using the action selected by the main network.

To implement this change in code, you need to replace the line:

target = reward + gamma * target_net(next_state).max(1)[0].detach()

with:

target = reward + gamma * target_net(next_state)[action].detach()

where reward, gamma, target_net, next_state, and action are variables that store the corresponding values. 

This will make your code use the DQN algorithm instead of the DDQN algorithm.

I hope this helps you understand how to switch from DDQN to DQN. If you want to learn more about these algorithms, you can check out these resources:
