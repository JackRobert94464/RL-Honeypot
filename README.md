# RL-Honeypot

## Description
This is an implementation of honeypot system using reinforcement learning. The system is designed to be able to detect and mitigate APT attacks. The system is implemented using Python 3.7.4 and Tensorflow 2.0.0. Through reinforcement learning, the system is able to learn the optimal policy to mitigate attack coming from attacker by making them believe that they are successfully attacking the system. The system is able to learn the optimal policy by observing the attacker's behavior and the system's state.
