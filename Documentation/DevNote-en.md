22/03/2024 - Review EPSS generation code, seperating CSV cleaning with EPSS adding code
I decide to gather all the data about cve from mitre rather than manually adding.
It's good to have a full database afterall. Even if we don't use them all up.
https://cve.mitre.org/data/downloads/index.html
I download the file as a CSV, then write a code to add the EPSS using that very same database
